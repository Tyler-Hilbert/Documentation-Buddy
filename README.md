# Documentation Buddy  
Research shows that developers spend 59% of their time on code comprehension tasks. Despite developers spending more time reading code than writing code, majority of software tools that exist today focus on one of the 3 categories: 1) improved environment setups, 2) packages that enable faster writing of code, 3) task and project management tools.  
  
Poor software documentation increases development time long term, increases bugs and decreases the lifetime of software before it becomes unmaintainable. Documentation Buddy solves the issue of undocumented, poorly documented or incorrectly documented code.  

# Roadmap  
## Phase 1  
A modified version of git that prevents undocumented code from being merged into the main code base.  

## Phase 2  
Basic forms of AI and MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity) will be used to identify when documentation is outdated and needs to be revised.  

## Phase 3
Cutting edge NLP and machine learning will be implemented to automatically generate documentation for code snippets. Existing documentation will automatically be verified for correctness in addition to being up to date.  

## Phase 4  
RPA (Robotic Process Automation) will be implemented to verify the correctness of installation processes and environment setup.
