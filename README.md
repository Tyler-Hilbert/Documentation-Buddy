# Documentation Buddy  
[![Github All Releases](https://shields.io/endpoint?url=https://ossrank.com/shield/877)]
93% of developers report having problems with documentation. This is the highest self-reported problem of any problem by software developers. Research shows that developers spend 58% of their time on code comprehension tasks. That means that "writing code" is more reading code and documentation than it is actually writing code. This raises some interesting questions. Why are the majority of software developer tools focused on faster ways to write code when reading it is more time consuming and frustrating? Also, does creating documentation have to be a painful process that 93% of developers are unsatisfied with the results?    

Documentation Buddy utilizes artificial intelligence and open source software to reinvent the way code is documented!    

# Roadmap  
## Phase 1  
A modified version of git that prevents undocumented code from being merged into the main code base.  

## Phase 2  
Basic forms of AI and MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity) will be used to identify when documentation is outdated and needs to be revised.  

## Phase 3
Cutting edge NLP and machine learning will be implemented to automatically generate documentation for code snippets. Existing documentation will automatically be verified for correctness in addition to being up to date.  

## Phase 4  
RPA (Robotic Process Automation) will be implemented to verify the correctness of installation processes and environment setup.  

# Are Tools for Software Developers Really That Big of a Deal?  
Yes, software developer tools is a $3.8B market that directly impacts the overall software development market, a $430B industry.  

# Usage  
1) git clone https://github.com/Tyler-Hilbert/Documentation-Buddy.git  
2) cd Documentation-Buddy
3) mkdir test   
4) \# copy the codebase you want to analyze into Documentation-Buddy/test/  
5) python3 Parser.py
